      <p> Except for a 3 year stint as a performing & studio musician, I have spent my life designing
          and developing databases and business applications, writing how-to books, consulting, teaching, and training.</p>
      <p>I've worked in a variety of industries with a variety of companies and organizations &mdash; large & small, public & private, 
         non-profit & academic institutions. Iâ€™ve gained a large base of knowledge as a consequence of this wide experience, which enables me to successfully serve many types of client.
      </p>
      <p>
          I have designed and built applications ranging from relatively simple
          estimators/calculators to complete systems that handle core tasks: customer service, contacts/sales,
          inventory, process tracking, project tracking, scheduling, donor management, clinical drug trials, and many
          more. I have written applications for commercial distribution as well as for my clients' in-house use.
      </p>
      <p>
          I am also a skilled technical writer. I am sole author, co-author, or a contributing author of over 20
          technical how-to books, most of which teach database programming in Visual Basic and MS Access VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), and VBA programming in MS Excel.
      </p>
