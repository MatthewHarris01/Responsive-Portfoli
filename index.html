        <p class="arbody">
          Except for a brief (3 year) stint as a performing and studio musician, I have spent my life designing
          and developing databases and business applications, writing how-to books, consulting, teaching, and training.
        </p>
        <p class="arbody">
          I've had the good fortune to work in a variety of industries with a variety of companies and organizations –
          large & small, public & private, non-profit and academic institutions. I’ve gained a large base of knowledge
          as a
          consequence of this wide experience, which enables me to successfully serve many types of client.
        </p>
        <p class="arbody">
          I take tremendous satisfaction from knowing that the applications I develop make people's lives easier
          and meet their unique needs. I have designed and built applications ranging from relatively simple
          estimators/calculators to complete systems that handle core tasks: customer service, contacts/sales,
          inventory, process tracking, project tracking, scheduling, donor management, clinical drug trials, and many
          more. I have written applications for commercial distribution as well as for my clients' in-house use.
        </p>
        <p class="arbody">
          I strive to create reliable, easily maintained and well-documented applications – it's a good feeling to
          deliver a reliable tool to the people who need it.
        </p>
        <p class="arbody">
          I am also a skilled technical writer. I am sole author, co-author, or a contributing author of over 20
          technical how-to books, most of which teach database programming in Visual Basic and MS Access VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), and VBA programming in MS Excel.
