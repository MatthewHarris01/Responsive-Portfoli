# Responsive-Portfolio
Version 0.1; index.html is working as expected now. contact.html and portfolio.html have nto yet been converted. 
ISSUE IN index.html -- the color background of the masthead shrinks more than the text when the page is narrowed. I have not yet found a solution to this issue.
contact.html, and portfolio.html are still the same as completed for the bsic-portfolio project, having zero responsive coding in place.
