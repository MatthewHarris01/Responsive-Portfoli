# Responsive-Portfolio
Version 1.0; index.html, contact.html, and portfolio.html are working as expected now.
ISSUE IN index.html, contact.html and portfolio.html -- the color background of the masthead shrinks more than the text when the page is narrowed. I have not yet found a solution to this issue.
ISSUE IN portfolio.html -- putting more than 4 "work" divs in the <section> tag, causes the "work" divs to overflow out of the <section> tag and overwrite the <footer> tag. I hve not yet found the cause of this issue.
NOTE: on the portfolio page, all the listed projects have an <a> tag added, so that clicking the name of the portfolio item causes a new page to open, showing the portfolio item.
Version 1.1 -- Portfolio page modified to use a table to display portfolio items, also added url/<a> tags for class projects, updated to show Crystal Gatherer game. using a table to display the portfolio projects eliminates the issues noted previously, the sticky footer works correctly, and the content does not overflow over the footer.
