# Responsive-Portfolio
Version 2.0; index.html, contact.html, and portfolio.html are working as expected now.
ISSUE IN index.html, contact.html and portfolio.html -- the color background of the masthead shrinks more than the text when the page is narrowed. I have not yet found a solution to this issue.
ISSUE IN portfolio.html -- putting more than 4 "work" divs in the <section> tag, causes the "work" divs to overflow out of the <section> tag and overwrite the <footer> tag. I hve not yet found the cause of this issue.
NOTE: on the portfolio page, all the listed projects have an <a> tag added, so that clicking the name of the portfolio item causes a new page to open, showing the portfolio item.
Version 1.1 -- Portfolio page modified to use a table to display portfolio items, also added url/<a> tags for class projects, updated to show Crystal Gatherer game. using a table to display the portfolio projects eliminates the issues noted previously, the sticky footer works correctly, and the content does not overflow over the footer.
Version 2.0 -- majority of repsonsiveness issues resolved, especially for index.html and portfolio.htm.
Version 2.1 -- GIF Search app added to portfolio.html page.

Version 3.0 -- resolved remaining issues with sticky footer for all pages. Tested responsive behavior for all pages, modified all pages as needed to improve responsiveness.
About page: made cosmetic changes, in particular reduced the size of the portrait photo to improve the readabileiy of wrapped text.
Contact page: Added links to LinkedIn and Git Hub, also added a link to a pdf version of my current resume on. Added a mailto: link to contact page, and my phone number. Added "disbled" attribute to all fields and buttons on the Contact form, since message sending code is not implemented at this time. 
Portfolio page: re-made the table of projects and apps for better visual appeal. Changed styles to make links more easily readable, and to make visited links more readable. Added overflow scrolling to Portfolio page, since the list of demo apps is likely to exceed the height of the visible area in the future, and currently exceeds the visible height for many mobile devices.
