# Responsive-Portfolio
Version 0.2; index.html and contact.html are working as expected now. portfolio.html has noto yet been converted. 
ISSUE IN index.html and portfolio.html -- the color background of the masthead shrinks more than the text when the page is narrowed. I have not yet found a solution to this issue.
portfolio.html is still the same as completed for the basic-portfolio project, having zero responsive coding in place.
